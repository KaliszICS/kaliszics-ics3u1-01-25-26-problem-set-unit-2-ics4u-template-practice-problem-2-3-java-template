# Problem Set Unit 2: Email Validator and Parser

In this problem set, you will create a program that validates email addresses according to specific rules, extracts components, and formats them according to different domain requirements.

---

## Option 1: Basic Email Validation (80% Completion)

Write a program that:

1. Takes one input:
   - An email address (a string)

2. Outputs whether the email is valid or invalid based on these basic rules (in this exact order):
   - Email must contain exactly one @ symbol
   - Email must not start or end with a dot (.)
   - Email must not contain spaces
   - The local part (before @) must be between 1-64 characters
   - The domain part (after @) must contain at least one dot
   - The domain extension (after final dot) must be 2-6 characters
   - The domain extension must only contain letters

**Example:**
```
Input an email: john.doe@example.com
Valid
```

**Invalid Examples:**
```
Input an email: john.doe@example
Invalid

Input an email: john..doe@example.com
Invalid

Input an email: @example.com
Invalid
```

**Requirements:**
- Check rules in the order specified above
- Stop checking after the first invalid rule is found
- Output only "Valid" or "Invalid"
- Ensure the code is well-structured with appropriate variable names, spacing, comments, and documentation
- Avoid unnecessary code repetition for efficiency

## Option 2: Domain-Specific Rules and Exception Handling (90% Completion)

Enhance the program to handle exceptions and domain-specific validation rules:

1. Keep all validation from Option 1, but now output which rule failed:
   - If invalid, output: "Invalid: [reason]"
   - Possible reasons: "Missing @", "Multiple @", "Starts or ends with dot", "Contains spaces", "Local part too long", "Local part too short", "No dot in domain", "Invalid domain extension length", "Domain extension contains non-letters"

2. Add these exceptions to the basic rules:
   - **Exception A**: Subdomains are allowed (e.g., mail.google.com is valid)
   - **Exception B**: Numbers are allowed in the local part and domain name (but NOT in the extension)
   - **Exception C**: The characters + and _ are allowed in the local part only
   - **Exception D**: Gmail addresses may have dots removed automatically (treat john.doe@gmail.com and johndoe@gmail.com as equivalent for validation purposes)

3. Handle edge cases:
   - If Exception D applies, output the normalized version: "Valid (Gmail normalized)"
   - If multiple exceptions apply, still output "Valid"
   - Validate that exceptions don't allow invalid characters in restricted areas

**Examples:**
```
Input an email: user+tag@mail.example.co.uk
Valid

Input an email: john_doe@sub.domain.com
Valid

Input an email: jane.doe@gmail.com
Valid (Gmail normalized)

Input an email: invalid@domain.5yz
Invalid: Domain extension contains non-letters
```

**Requirements:**
- Validate in the order specified in Option 1
- Check for exceptions AFTER determining if the email would be invalid under basic rules
- Apply exceptions only where they are applicable
- Maintain clear, efficient code structure

## Option 3: Multiple Email Input with Formatting (100% Completion)

Improve your code from the previous options to:

1. Take a single input containing two email addresses separated by a comma and space
2. Process each email individually using all validation rules from Option 2
3. Output the results for each email on separate lines
4. Extract and display the local part and domain separately for each valid email

**Example:**
```
Input two emails: john.doe@example.com, invalid@domain.5yz
john.doe@example.com: Valid | Local: john.doe | Domain: example.com
invalid@domain.5yz: Invalid: Domain extension contains non-letters
```

**Additional Example:**
```
Input two emails: user+tag@mail.example.co.uk, jane.doe@gmail.com
user+tag@mail.example.co.uk: Valid | Local: user+tag | Domain: mail.example.co.uk
jane.doe@gmail.com: Valid (Gmail normalized) | Local: jane.doe | Domain: gmail.com
```

**Requirements:**
- Parse exactly two emails from a single input (separated by ", " or comma)
- Maintain all validation from Option 2 for each email
- Extract local part and domain for valid emails
- Modify your existing code rather than starting from scratch
